-The ball would break if it falls too hard on the platforms (also good for diffuculty)
-Bounciness of the ball make it harder to play(jelly like)
-modify the drag and mass at realtime to make the game interresting and harder
-variation in turning speed of platforms is good idea
-jump force has jitter
-collectables mid air effect platform shader like power ups and stuff
-visuals play on the wall 
-camera vibration when Skipping Platforms with pickables + particle effects
